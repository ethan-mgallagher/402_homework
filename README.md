C++/ Advanced Programming
//This program tests an object-oriented against a generic programming approach for c++ programming.
//An interface for object implementing a isLessThan method is used to implement two wrapper classes OOInt
/*And OOStr, which wrap ints and strings respectively.
 *
 * A template class, genericWrapper and functor "comparator" are also implemented.
 *
 * Both the Object-oriented and generic approach are then tested with various-sized vectors in an iterative
 * mergesort implementation. The generic approach achieves superior results, due to the extra overhead of
 * dynamic dispatch in the object-oriented approach.
